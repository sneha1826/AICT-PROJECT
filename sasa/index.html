                <h1> NUTRITION</h1>
                <p> Nutrition is the science that studies the foods we eat and how they affect our health
                    and well-being. A healthy diet provides the body with the essential nutrients it needs
                    to function properly, including carbohydrates, proteins,fats, vitamins, and minerals.
                    Carbohydrates give us energy to perform daily activities, proteins help in building and
                    repairing muscles and tissues, and fats support brain function and provide long-term
                    energy. Vitamins and minerals are vital for a strong immune system, healthy bones, and
                    overall growth. Eating a balanced diet not only fuels our body but also prevents
                    diseases such as diabetes, heart problems, and obesity. Proper nutrition is
                    especially important for children and adolescents, as it supports growth and cognitive
                    development. Additionally, drinking enough water and avoiding excessive sugar, salt, and
                    unhealthy fats are crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By understanding
                    nutrition and making smart food choices, we can improve our energy levels, mental focus,
                    and overall quality of life leading to a happier and healthier future. </p>
