            <h1>PROTEIN</h1>

            <p class="intro">
                Protein is a vital nutrient that plays an important role in keeping the
                body strong and healthy. It is required for building and maintaining
                body tissues such as muscles, skin, and organs. Protein also supports
                many internal processes that allow the body to function properly every day.
            </p>

            <p class="intro">
                Unlike carbohydrates and fats, protein is not stored in large amounts
                in the body. This means it must be consumed regularly through daily
                meals to meet the body's needs. A consistent intake of protein helps
                maintain strength, balance, and overall physical well-being.
            </p>

            <h3>Benefits of Proteins</h3>

            <p class="intro">
                Proteins perform several essential functions beyond muscle development.
                They help repair damaged tissues, support cell growth, and assist in
                producing enzymes and hormones that regulate body activities. Adequate
                protein intake helps the body recover faster from physical stress. Other
                benefits include the following:

                    <li>Supports the immune system and disease resistance</li>
                    <li>Plays a role in enzyme and hormone production</li>

            <h3>Protein Sources</h3>

            <p class="intro">Proteins can be found in a variety of foods, including animals and plants. Protein should be obtained
                from multiple sources.
                Some common sources include:</p>

            <div class="lists">
                <ul>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Milk & Dairy Products</li>
                    <li>Fish</li>
                    <li>Beans & Pulses</li>
                    <li>Nuts & Seeds</li>
                    <li>Chicken & Meat</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="intro">
            On average, these foods provide between 6 and 25 grams of protein.
            </p>
            <h3>Protein Deficiency</h3>

            <p class="intro">
                A lack of protein in the diet can lead to weakness, fatigue, and slow
                recovery from illness or injury. Long-term protein deficiency may affect
                muscle strength and growth, especially in children and physically active
                individuals.

                <h4>Recommended Intake:</h4>
                <p>
                    The recommended intake of protein depends on age, activity level, and health goals.
                    For most adults, it is suggested to consume around 0.8-1.2 grams per kilogram of
                    body weight daily.
                    For individuals engaged in regular exercise, strength training, or trying to gain muscle, intake
                    should be higher, around 1.2-2.2 grams per kilogram
