      <h1>Carbohydrates</h1>

      <p class="intro">
        Carbohydrates are an essential macronutrient that provide energy to
        the body. They are broken down into glucose, which is used by our
        brain, muscles, and organs to perform daily activities. Without enough
        carbohydrates, the body may feel weak and tired.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        Carbohydrates are especially important for students and active
        individuals because they help improve concentration, memory, and
        physical performance. Choosing the right type of carbohydrates is very
        important for maintaining good health.
      </p>

      <h3>Beneficial (Healthy) Carbohydrates</h3>
      <p class="intro">
        Healthy carbohydrates are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They
        are digested slowly and help maintain stable blood sugar levels.
      </p>
      <div class="lists">
        <ul>
          <li>Whole grains such as brown rice, oats, and whole wheat bread</li>
          <li>Fresh fruits like apples, bananas, and berries</li>
          <li>Vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, and spinach</li>
          <li>Legumes including lentils, beans, and chickpeas</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>Less Beneficial (Unhealthy) Carbohydrates</h3>
      <p class="intro">
        Unhealthy carbohydrates are highly processed and contain added sugars.
        They provide quick energy but have very low nutritional value and may
        cause weight gain and health problems if consumed frequently.
      </p>
      <div class="lists">
        <ul>
          <li>White sugar and sweets</li>
          <li>Soft drinks and sugary juices</li>
          <li>White bread and refined flour products</li>
          <li>Fast food and packaged snacks</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p class="intro">
        On average, these carbohydrate sources provide roughly 15-
        30 grams of carbohydrates. To stay healthy, it is recommended to consume more complex
        carbohydrates and limit the intake of simple and processed
        carbohydrates.
      </p>

      <h3>Carbohydrate Deficiency</h3>
      <p class="intro">
        Carbohydrate deficiency can lead to fatigue, weakness, and difficulty
        concentrating. It may also result in the body using protein for energy,
        which is not ideal for muscle maintenance and growth.
      </p>

        <h4>Recommended Intake</h4>
        <p>
          The recommended intake of carbohydrates depends on activity level and energy needs.
          For most sedentary adults, an intake of about 3-5 grams per kilogram of body weight per day is sufficient.
          For individuals who exercise regularly or have higher training demands, carbohydrate intake should be higher,
          generally around 5-10 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, to support performance and recovery.
