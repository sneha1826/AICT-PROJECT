            <p class="intro">
                Fats are one of the three main nutrients required by the human body, along with
                carbohydrates and proteins. They are present in many everyday foods and form an
                important part of a balanced diet. Although fats are often misunderstood or avoided,
                they are necessary for normal body structure and basic biological functions. They
                are commonly divided into saturated and unsaturated fats based on their chemical structure.

                Unlike carbohydrates, fats provide a slow and steady source of energy that helps
                the body function over longer periods. They play a key role in maintaining body
                temperature and protecting vital organs from physical damage.

                <p>
                    The recommended intake of fats depends on age, activity level, and health goals.
                    For most adults, it is suggested to consume around 0.5-1.2 grams of fat per kilogram of body weight
                    daily.
                    For individuals who are very active or trying to build muscle, intake can be slightly higher, around
                    1.5-2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight.
